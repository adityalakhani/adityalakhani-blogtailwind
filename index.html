     Tailwind CSS is a popular and <span class="text-blue-500 font-bold italic">powerful CSS

     One of the key benefits of Tailwind CSS is that it promotes
     consistency in design by providing a set of pre-defined classes that
     can be used across an entire website or application. This helps to
     ensure that all elements are styled consistently, which can make it
     <span class="font-bold"> easier to maintain and update the design over time.</span>

    <p class="pt-1 pb-3">
     Examples of such utility classes includes the
     <span class="font-bold">"text-center"</span> class can be used to center align text,
     while the <span class="font-bold">"bg-gray-200"</span> class can be used to add a light
     gray background color to an element.
